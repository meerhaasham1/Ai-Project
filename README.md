# Hand Gesture Cursor Control AI Project

This project is aimed at controlling the cursor using hand gestures with Python and computer vision techniques.

## Overview

This AI project utilizes a hand tracking algorithm combined with computer vision to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
By analyzing the movements of the hand, the project controls the cursor on the screen accordingly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-cursor-control.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd hand-gesture-cursor-control

3. Run the `main.py` script:
python main.py

4. The program will start capturing the webcam feed. Position of the handshould be in the front.

5. Hand movement can control the cursor on the screen.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
